                <h3>Usefulness of Cats</h3>
                <img src="assets/media/cat.jpg" alt="Cat" class="image">
                <p>
                    In our urban and suburban houses what should we do 
                    without cats? In our sitting or bedrooms, our 
                    libraries, in our kitchens and storerooms, our 
                    farms, barns, and rickyards, in our docks, our 
                    granaries, our ships, and our wharves, in our 
                    corn markets, meat markets, and other places too 
                    numerous to mention, how useful they are! In our 
                    ships, however, the rats oft set them at defiance; 
                    still they are of great service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How wonderfully patient is the cat when watching 
                    for rats or mice, awaiting their egress from their 
                    place of refuge or that which is their home! How 
                    well Shakespeare in Pericles, Act iii., describes 
                    this keen attention of the cat to its natural pursuit!
                </p>
                <span class="span">
                    The cat, with eyne of burning coal,
                    Now crouches from (before) the mouse's hole.
                </span>
                <p>
                    A slight rustle, and the fugitive comes forth; a quick, 
                    sharp, resolute motion, and the cat has proved its 
                    usefulness. Let any one have a plague of rats and mice, 
                    as I once had, and let them be delivered therefrom by 
                    cats, as I was, and they will have a lasting and kind 
                    regard for them.
                </p>
